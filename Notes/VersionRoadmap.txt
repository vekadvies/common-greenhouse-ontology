Final Version Wishes:
- not an ultimate ontology
- A clear methodology, what is used to build this ontology
    - model technical choices
    - software
    - output
    - terms
    - What are the main greenhouse systems?
- A report about the ontology
- DDINGS ontology: describe and define in the proper way if it's possible to include all the main systems:
    - crop
    - heating
- Have an overview to which detail level which class is filled in, maybe in percentages
- Have references in the form of book/literature/articles
