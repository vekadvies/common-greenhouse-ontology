It mainly describes Dutch greenhouses, but can also be applied to greenhouses outside of The Netherlands. The ontology describes multiple aspects of the domain of greenhouses: the construction, the technical systems, the crops, and data about crops. Next to the entities we added together with domain experts, we also reuse ontologies. For the data about crops we use the Semantic Sensor Network Ontology (SSN) (Haller et al., 2017) and  Ontology of units of Measure (OM) (de Vos et al., 2017), together with a 'part of' strategy to describe different aspects crops and systems. For the crops themselves we use aspects of the crop ontology (CO) (Shrestha et a., 2012)." ;

      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

      \"Derivative Works\" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the

          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a \"NOTICE\" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not

          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and

      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,

      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the

      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

It is a value calculated according to the specifications / characteristics of the heating system. This is a max value which means that for example the boiler can not provide more that this. For example for a greenhouse of 10000m2 (1ha) if this value is 120W/m2, and the combinded efficiency of the boiler + distribution system is 85%, the max heating power can be provided by the boiler is 120*10000/85% = 1.41MW. This is a simple example without any heat storage. If we have a heat storage, which is very common, then the max heating power from the boiler can be different than 1.41MW.
Heating capacity depends strongly from the area. There are areas where there are small heating needs and then this value can be even less than 50W/m2 and areas with high needs, this value can be even higher than 200W/m2.""" ;

For the first related to CO2 source, we have mainly two sources, either pure CO2 stored in special tanks or CO2 which is obtained from exhaust gas (we use also the term flue gas) which is emitted as a result of the combustion of fuels such as natural gas.   

In general, CO2 enrichment decreases the oxygen inhibition of photosynthesis and increases the net photosynthesis in plants. This is the basis for increased growth rates caused by CO2 at low as well as at high light levels. Elevated CO2 concentrations also increase the optimal temperature for growth. Pot plants, cut flowers, vegetables and forest plants show very positive effects from CO2 enrichment by increased dry weight, plant height, number of leaves and lateral branching. Plant quality expressed by growth habit and number of flowers is often enhanced by CO2 enrichment. The rooting of cuttings is often stimulated by high CO2 levels.""" ;

The coldest surfaces will be the piping, door knobs, roof and eventually the plants. For example, when the greenhouse is 85% RH and 60°F, condensation occurs when leaf temperature is lower than 55°F.

Belangrijk voordeel van deze keuze is dat het een algemeen bruikbare definitie is zonder dat er aannames worden gemaakt over de constructie van de kas.

Warm air has a higher moisture-holding capacity than cooler air; therefore as the temperature of air increases, the relative humidity decreases even though the amount of water remains constant. Air at 70° F will hold twice as much moisture as air at 50°F. In the range of temperatures encountered in a greenhouse, for every 20° F rise in dry bulb temperature, the water-holding capacity of the air doubles, and the relative humidity is reduced by one-half.

CO defines a trait as a character of an individual plant or of a group of plants that can be
observed and that results from the expression of its genes and their interaction with the
environment. This trait definition can be summarized by “what is observed”. Examples of traits
are “plant height’, “pod color”, “grain yield”, “seed germination rate”, “plant flowering time”,
“panicle shape”, “plant resistance to blight”, etc.
Traits can be formalized by a meaningful combination of entities and attributes. The entity
is the observed plant part. The entity can be defined at the level of the cell, the tissue, the
organ, the whole organism or the sub-product of the crop. The attribute is the feature of an
entity. Attributes can be states or processes. Examples of states are weight, length, area,
color, chemical content, while examples of processes are vegetative period duration,
photosynthesis rate, senescence rate.
A direct consequence of the trait decomposition into entity and attribute is that two traits that
share the same combination of attributes are identical even though they are named differently.
Thus, decomposing a trait into entity/attribute is a good practice to prevent trait duplication.
Table 3 shows examples of trait breakdown into entity/attribute.
A trait can be described by a general entity or as a specimen, something that obviously belongs
to an entity but is noticed by reason of an individual distinguishing characteristic. Examples of
specimen are primary branch, first flower, first grade commercial fruit, flag leaf, third leaf, main
stem, fertile stem, mature fruit, immature fruit.""" ;

        rdfs:comment "Vapour-pressure deficit, or VPD, is the difference (deficit) between the amount of moisture in the air and how much moisture the air can hold when it is saturated. Once air becomes saturated, water will condense out to form clouds, dew or films of water over leaves. It is this last instance that makes VPD important for greenhouse regulation. If a film of water forms on a plant leaf, it becomes far more susceptible to rot. On the other hand, as the VPD increases, the plant needs to draw more water from its roots. In the case of cuttings, the plant may dry out and die. For this reason the ideal range for VPD in a greenhouse is from 0.45 kPa to 1.25 kPa, ideally sitting at around 0.85 kPa. As a general rule, most plants grow well at VPDs of between 0.8 and 0.95 kPa." .

The cooling power is related to the performance (COP) of the cooling system and for simplicity we can assume that is 3 times more than the cooling power. So if we have 150 W/m2 electrical cooling power and COP=3, the max cooling power applied in the greenhouse is 150 * 3 = 450 W/m2.""" ;
